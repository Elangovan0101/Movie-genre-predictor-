# Movie Genre Predictor

## Overview

Welcome to the Movie Genre Predictor project! This initiative leverages advanced natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning (ML) techniques to predict the genre of a movie based on its plot summary. By harnessing the power of textual data, this project enhances user experience in exploring and categorizing movies.

### Features Data Source

The project utilizes a meticulously curated dataset containing movie plots paired with their respective genres. This dataset serves as the foundation for training and evaluating the genre prediction model.

### Technological Stack

- **Python**: Developed using Python for its flexibility and robust ecosystem.
- **scikit-learn**: Utilizing scikit-learn for its comprehensive ML tools and algorithms.
- **pandas**: Employing pandas for efficient data manipulation and preprocessing.
- **NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)**: Integrating NLTK for advanced NLP capabilities.

## Methodology

### Data Preprocessing

- **Handling Missing Values**: Robust strategies are implemented to manage missing data and ensure data integrity.
- **Text Cleaning and Tokenization**: Advanced techniques are used to clean and tokenize textual data effectively.
- **Feature Engineering**: Textual data is transformed into numerical features using methods like CountVectorizer and TF-IDF Transformer.

### Model Training

- **Multinomial Naive Bayes Classifier**: The core model is a Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier, chosen for its effectiveness in text classification tasks.
- **Dataset Splitting**: The dataset is split into training and testing sets to evaluate model performance accurately.

### Evaluation

- **Performance Metrics**: The model's performance is rigorously evaluated using metrics such as accuracy and classification reports.
